# Installing:
- Other install methods will be added soon, this page will be updated once those are ready.
- For more information on installing please refer to this [guide](https://ios.cfw.guide/using-lyncis)
- There is no warranty with this software, so use at your own risk.

#### Using Safari:
1. Visit https://lyncisjb.com on your device
2. Press "Jailbreak", your device will reboot once finished
3. Cydia will now be on your home screen and can be used like normal

If Safari crashes during the jailbreak process, this means the jailbreak has likely failed.
You can check the reason for the failure in the crash logs for Safari. 
These can be found from the Settings app, then `General -> About -> Diagnostics and Usage -> Diagnostics and Usage`.

#### Migrating from Pangu/evasi0n7:
1. Open Cydia and add the following repo: http://lyncisjb.com/repo
2. Install "Lyncis Untether" from the repo (remove old untether package first)
3. Reboot your device

# Other Info:
